[13:34:50] <doctea> so, market research.  what do you think CV inputs could be used for on a euclidian rhythm generating device
[13:35:49] <na> oh this is a great question doctea
[13:38:58] <doctea> i have it so like, there are 20 channels of euclidian rhythms each outputing a different drum trigger
[13:39:38] <doctea> so one thing that i think would be interesting is a 'channel offset' cv, so eg -10v to +10v would tranpose which trigger each channel is using.  so kick rhythm would play on snare, snare on hats, etc
[13:39:48] <na> so in my own patches, I sometimes run a euclidian pattern and another pattern created on another sequencer into an OR logic to trigger a slightly varying pattern; I usually do this for kick drums
[13:40:03] <na> so regarding CV
[13:40:11] <doctea> nice yeah.  also an AND/NAND/XOR would be good for that to make more variations of patterns
[13:40:19] <na> Maybe something that indroduces an additional trigger?
[13:40:43] <doctea> additional trigger how?
[13:44:26] <na> so let's say I have a 3/5 euclidian pattern or a 4/9 pattern for a kick drum; have some CV that increases the number hits depending on voltage, but never letting it reaching 1 (e.g. 5/5 and 9/9)
[13:44:59] <doctea> na: hmmm almost like a "density" cv?
[13:45:10] <na> But, that additional trigger falls within a musically timed range
[13:45:16] <na> yeah, i think so, doctea
[13:45:19] <na> exactly
[13:45:21] <na> idk
[13:45:29] <na> just throwing out ideas
[13:45:36] <doctea> yea plz keep them coming
[13:45:52] <na> maybe it's bipolar so it can either add or remove
[13:46:05] <na> instead of unipolar
[13:46:36] <na> another option would be CV that extends or shorten the gate trigger
[13:46:39] <doctea> i have a 'density' control in my current implementation, but i only apply changes to the pattern at the start of every phrase / last bar of phrase; but because of how euclidian generation works, if you increase the pulse count by 1 then the rhythm also changes
[13:46:59] <na> Gotcha
[13:47:03] <doctea> duration would be a good one for musical notes, less useful for drums, but good shout
[13:47:30] <na> instead of length, maybe rachet?
[13:47:31] <doctea> could maybe do a stutter/ratchet effect tho
[13:47:34] <na> boom
[13:47:36] <na> lolol
[13:47:37] <doctea> :D
[13:48:11] <doctea> i think i might be able to regenerate the patterns every step and still have enough cpu to do everything else too so maybe that would be interesting to try
[13:48:14] <na> gonna be buying dem doctea stonks in the near future
[13:48:39] <doctea> yeah ratchet, also maybe 'echoes'?  so it would actually add an extra trigger after the trigger
[13:49:01] <na> unrelated but related, are you familiar with the Intellijel Planar?
[13:49:47] <doctea> (and yea so far this new device is looking like it might be relatively cheap to put together.. prototypes might be available in the not too distant future)
[13:51:18] <doctea> one thing about this new device though is it that it is rigged up to receive and send midi - so it would receive midi clock over usb and send notes/triggers over trs midi, idk how much midi you guys have in your systems and whether that would be useful
[13:52:33] <doctea> my use case is that i will use another module for doing the midi->cv trigger stuff and will clock it from my main master clock which already syncs usb/midi/cv
[13:52:53] <na> I only implement MIDI out via Pams New Workout expander
[13:53:10] <na> to start/stop my drum machines that I barely use lolol
[13:53:14] <doctea> but i think cv-clock-in might be a necessity
[13:54:47] <doctea> yea hmm.  there is a relatively cheap (like probably a Â£50 kit?) midi to 11 triggers + 5 cv output that would be the companion to this new device
[13:55:53] <doctea> being able to take a midi output from this new device and pass it to a drum machine is one of the use cases i'm imagining too
[19:39:12] <@johnnyC> !tell doctea if you could pick a waveform and length to output as part of the cv out thatd be neat to have like a euclidean lfo?
[19:40:04] <doctea> so the length of the lfo would be the time interval between the pulses?
[19:40:19] <doctea> s/length/cycle period
